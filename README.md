### Library for raisoning about knowledge using epistemic modal logic and Kripke models

To run the library : 
* `ant run_muddy` to run the **Muddy Children** problem
* `ant run_pileface` to run the **Pile ou Face** problem
* `ant run_pnotp` to run the **P not P** problem
* `ant run_sumproduct` to run the **Sum And Product** problem
* `ant run_sumproductrapide` to run the **Sum And Product** problem (*faster* version)

Thanks to *Pr. Bruno Zanuttini (Full professor at the Universit√© de Caen Normandie)* for having proposed this subject and for the help in the implementation.
Project completed during my first year of Master (2016/2017).
